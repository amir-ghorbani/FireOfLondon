                <p>Samuel Pepys ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from the battlements. He
                    recorded in his diary that the eastern gale had turned it into a conflagration. It had burned down
                    an estimated 300 houses and reached the riverfront. The houses on London Bridge were burning.</p>
