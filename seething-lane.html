                <h2>Diarist Samuel Pepys</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="elements">
                <p>Samuel Pepys was an English diarist and naval administrator. He served as administrator of the Navy
                    of England and Member of Parliament and is most famous for the diary he kept for a decade while
                    still a young man.<br>
                    The detailed private diary that Pepys kept from 1660 until 1669 was first published in the 19th
                    century and is one of the most important primary sources for the English Restoration period. It
                    provides a combination of personal revelation and eyewitness accounts of great events, such as the
                    Great Plague of London, the Second Dutch War, and the Great Fire of London.<br>
                    Pepysâ€™ home was located in Seething Lane.</p>
