                <p>A royal proclamation put a stop to construction until new regulations had been ushered in.<br><br>

                    The 1667 Rebuilding Act aimed to eradicate risks which had helped the fire take hold, including
                    restrictions on upper floors of houses no longer being permitted to jut out over the floor
                    below.<br><br>

                    Importantly, building materials also changed. The 1667 act stated: "No man whatsoever shall presume
                    to erect any house or building, whether great or small, but of brick or stone."</p><br>
